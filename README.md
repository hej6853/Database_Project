ABC Game Store, a console games retailer, has shown a rapid growth since its start of business. As it grew, the store faced a number of challenges related to low customer satisfaction. Customers were complaining about in-store customer service, however, the current data held by the business could not generate any meaningful insights and also could not load any data related to solve the problem. To solve the problem, the business needed information generated by customers, transactions, products, product display, employee, employee schedule and employee rating data. With the new database system, the ABC game store was able to yield meaningful reports. Through the proposed database, the business can generate monthly sales reports based on customer information, monthly reports on employees’ customer service assessment, and report on peak hours and the current situation. These reports can facilitate the building of a positive customer in-store experience.

According to DBLC, the database for the business is in the fourth phase, testing and evaluation. The project has finished initial study, design, and implementation and loading phase and needs to take further actions in testing and evaluation, operation, and maintenance and evolution phase. The database needs to iteratively make improvements to address problems occurring.  Iteration of the updating the database will eliminate the bottlenecks of ABC game store business and potentially impact on creating additional economic values and securing customer loyalty.

## Further Improvement _Database Life Cycle Framework
For a database design, six phases of the database life cycle are needed: initial study, design, implementation and loading, testing and evaluation, operation, and maintenance and evolution. The ABC game store project was carried out to the middle of the testing and evaluation phase.  

First, in the initial study phase, the ABC game store's current situation is analyzed and problems are defined. The ABC game store has failed to generate meaningful outputs within the current spreadsheet because it has stored incomplete, denormalized, redundant, and not fully integrated conceptual data. Furthermore, because of failing to track the system operation, the ABC game store could not take action associated with customer dissatisfaction from the in-store customer service. Therefore, the proposed database was designed to solve the core problem, a poor in-store customer service quality, that we have identified. During the 'analyzing problems' process, we also recognized and defined two sets of limits; scope and boundaries --to improve the quality of customer service and train employees, the design will encompass the entire organization, ABC game store (extent). Also, considering ABC game store is a local-size store and the database will be used only for the internal employees, we as designers encouraged to spend the budget on using intuitive and cost-efficient software rather than spending budget on visual implementation software such as HTML.

Second, in the design phase, the information requirements were defined with the business' view and the designer’s view. It is important to take a step in identifying the real-world from the perspective of data and representing it as a conceptual model, which corresponds to a logical database design. The design process underwent three essential stages: conceptual, logical, and physical design. First, in the conceptual design process, our team created an Entity-Relation Diagram via MS Visio by changing the business requirements to a conceptual schema and specifying constraints on all sets of entities in the database and attribute relationships. Then, in the logical design process, we constructed a logically implementable data model from a conceptual design into an Excel file and decided MS Access as DBMS software. This is the process of converting to a user-recognizable form and defining a schema. For example, when creating a relational table containing customer information, it is made easy to understand by expressing it in the same form as a table consisting of items such as customer ID, name, and contact information. Lastly, in the physical design process, we went through the process of designing internal data storage structures and access paths to make the logical database structure easier for MS Access to handle. Especially we took into consideration methods of saving storage and avoiding redundancy to improve efficiency in data processing.

Third, in the implementation and loading phase, we established an actual database in MS Access using SQL queries based on what was obtained during the design process. We mainly used DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) to write simple, clear, consistent SQL queries along with the business requirement analysis. After the database has been created, the data saved in the excel file was loaded into the database tables and we confirmed all of the data was in a relational database so that it can be readily extracted based on the information requirements.  

Fourth, in the testing and evaluation phase, we can ensure whether the proposed database maintains the integrity and security of the data. Run simulations by extracting the data from several relational tables and making a summary report according to the queries from task 4 which may resolve the current ABC game store’s issues, we confirmed that our DBMS is in the proper use of primary and foreign key rules. This process ensured that these constraints were properly designed and implemented. In this phase, not only testing but also safe levels of data security should be guaranteed. Consequently, our team must further test for these data privacy issues such as physical security, password security, access rights, audit trails, data encryption, diskless workstations, etc. Also, to make sure the DBMS can support rapid transactions, our team needs to make sure the capacity of hardware and software is implemented with our database by fine-tuning the database. Then, we can evaluate the database and its application programs. Also, it is always crucial to ensure a plan for data loss which can be incurred by unintended deletions, power outages or other outside factors. Therefore, we should make sure to perform backup plans such as full backup, differential backup, and transaction log backup depending on the importance of the data.

Fifth, in the operation phase, real-world use of implemented databases identifies problems and improvements. In this phase, some of the issues that have not been addressed in the previous phase, testing and evaluation, might be identified and this leads to the last step, phase 6, maintenance and evolution.

Last but not least, in the maintenance and evolution phase, we can address the issues caused from the operation phase, and compare the data models, reviewing them whether they fit well together by keeping continuous enhancements.

Integration and expansion of the database system can provide an essential framework for more effective marketing measures. While ABC game store’s spreadsheet is only able to track total transactions, the proposed database system can analyze customers' purchase patterns, types, and complaints through the closely connected relational table. By combining with the stored customer information and employee's rating, come up with measures to prevent the losing customer or increase the store revisit rate. However, Customer Relationship Management activities will be successful only when the data is finely maintained and kept updated. In particular, to use basic customer data to accurately continuously update the data in the database, and associate cleansing tools to the database are necessary. As the business expands, the database may need to introduce additional business rules or expand and restrict employees' access to the database. In order for the database to respond flexibly to these situations, only iterative evaluation and revision are the way to get closer to the complete Database Life Cycle.

Intuitively, most people recognize the value of a great customer experience. The brand which provides this value is the brand that the customer is willing to interact with. According to Harvard Business Review, customers who have the best customer experiences spend 140% more than customers with the worst experiences. While customers who are not satisfied with the customer service will only increase by 40% sales per customer and there is little potential for revisiting the store. (Kriss The Value of Customer Experience, Quantified)

The introduction of ABC Game Store's new database is expected to eliminate bottlenecks in existing revenue structures and will bring additional 140% revenue growth potential, while enabling improved quality of customer service and systematic management of human resources.
